# DSA_CORE
This repository is a comprehensive collection of programs and examples focused entirely on Core Java concepts. It is designed to build a strong foundation in Java programming and help developers understand and master the essential features of the language.

What's Inside
Basic Syntax and Fundamentals: Programs covering variables, data types, operators, control statements, loops, and arrays.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Examples of classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Exception Handling: Programs to manage errors and exceptions effectively.
String Manipulations: Practical examples of working with Java Strings and StringBuilder/StringBuffer.
Collections Framework: In-depth exploration of ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, Set, and other collections.
Multithreading: Basics of threads, thread synchronization, and concurrency.
File I/O: Programs for reading and writing files using Javaâ€™s I/O streams.
Utility Classes: Examples of using utility classes like Math, Random, Scanner, and Date/Time APIs.
Problem-Solving: Practice problems to improve logic and coding skills using Core Java concepts.
Goals
Gain a thorough understanding of Core Java for both academic and practical purposes.
Strengthen problem-solving abilities with focused exercises.
Provide a structured reference for learning Core Java step by step.
